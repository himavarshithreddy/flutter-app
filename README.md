# Weather App - Flutter

This is a simple Flutter weather app that I built while learning the basics of Flutter development. It was one of my first projects to get hands-on experience with the framework. 

## Features

- Displays current temperature, weather condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy), humidity, wind speed, and pressure.
- Shows an hourly forecast for the next few hours.
- Allows users to search for weather information by city name.
- Refreshes weather data on demand.

## Usage

2. Press the search icon or "Enter" to get the weather data.
3. Use the refresh icon in the app bar to update the information.
